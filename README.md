Hello.

In order to run the code, you will need an user token. To get one, create a new account on https://discord.com/login, then open the Network tab, send a message to someone, inspect the payload, and copy your token. Alternatively, google how to get an user token on Discord.

#######################
DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT! Whilst it's against Discord's Terms of Service, it does not create any API spam, therefore it *SHOULD* not get your account banned, but you MUST be cautious.
#######################

Open the script and go to the last line, and add your token there. Example:

client.login('EagoenaG93ntg0923ng3')

Now, to test it, create a server on the account.

If it works, cool. If it doesn't, contact me.

Once again, I'm not responsible if your account gets banned for this, use it at your own risk.
